# ConnectED (MART Innovation - ED7)

## Overview
Our innovation is a mobile app designed to leverage existing smartphones and infrastructure to deliver educational content via radio broadcasts. By accessing local radio frequencies through phone hardware, the app ensures users can receive lessons without requiring an internet connection. This innovative approach encodes educational data (e.g., images, basic videos, and other custom content) over FM radio streams, enabling students to engage in literacy, numeracy, and essential skills in real-time.

### Key Features
- **Radio Broadcasts for Education**: Content is delivered via FM radio, ensuring accessibility in areas with limited infrastructure.
- **Offline and Online Modes**: Includes preloaded offline content and the option to fetch additional content when internet access is available.
- **Community Engagement**: Collaborates with local NGOs and community leaders to manage radio stations and ensure relevant content.
- **Low-Power Device Support**: Compatible with basic hardware such as solar-powered or low-powered devices.
- **Open Source**: Encourages contributions and improvements to sustain and scale the system.

### Benefits
- Provides quality education to children in remote or underserved areas.
- Reduces barriers such as travel distances and household responsibilities, particularly supporting girls' education.
- Promotes local relevance and community-driven content development.
- Breaks cycles of poverty by building foundational skills for career opportunities.
